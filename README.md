# Non_Linear_Partial_Differential_Equation_Solver
This code currently can solve a non linear partial differential equation in C++ without external libraries. It uses FInite Discretization, Newton Raphson Method, and 6 different linear equation solvers (GaussJacobi, GaussSiedel,Successive Over Relaxation, LU_Decomposition, Gauss-Jordan, Conjugate-BiGradient Method). 
The boundary conditions currently is onyl a cube from with corners at (0,0) and (1,1)
I took this up as a personal project and didn't mean to make anything new better. There are many existing Finite Element Softwares thar are more vast and useful
This repository can help you understand what happens in those softwares since everything was implemented from scratch
If you have any constructive about my code or any doubts send a mail at stsashank6@gmail.com
